        fixed chunk size.
    circular : bool
        Use if the genome is circular.
    out_dir : str or None
        Path where output files should be written. Current directory by default.
    tmp_dir : str or None
        Path where temporary files will be written. Creates a "tmp" folder in
        out_dir by default.
    plot : bool
        Whether plots should be generated at different steps of the pipeline.
        Plots are saved in a "plots" directory inside out_dir.
    min_qual : int
        Minimum mapping quality required to keep a pair of Hi-C reads.
    min_size : int
        Minimum contig size required to keep it.
    threads : int
        Number of threads to use for parallel operations.
    no_cleanup : bool
        Whether temporary files should be deleted at the end of the pipeline.
    iterative : bool
        Use iterative mapping. Truncates and extends reads until unambiguous
        alignment.
    filter_events : bool
        Filter spurious or uninformative 3C events. Requires a restriction enzyme.
    prefix : str or None
        Choose a common name for output files instead of default GRAAL names.
    start_stage : str
        Step at which the pipeline should start. Can be "fastq", "bam", "pairs"
        or "pairs_idx". With starting from bam allows to skip alignment and start 
        from named-sorted bam files. With
        "pairs", a single pairs file is given as input, and with "pairs_idx", the
        pairs in the input must already be attributed to fragments and fragment
        attribution is skipped.
    mat_fmt : str
        Select the output matrix format. Can be either "bg2" for the 
        cooler-compatible bedgraph2 format, or GRAAL format.
    aligner : str
        Read alignment software to use. Can be either "minimap2" or "bowtie2".
    pcr_duplicates : bool
        If True, PCR duplicates will be filtered based on genomic positions.
        Pairs where both reads have exactly the same coordinates are considered
        duplicates and only one of those will be conserved.
    distance_law : bool
        If True, generates a distance law file with the values of the probabilities 
        to have a contact between two distances for each chromosomes or arms if the
        file with the positions has been given. The values are not normalized, or 
        averaged.
    centromeres : None or str
        If not None, path of file with Positions of the centromeres separated by a
        space and in the same order than the chromosomes. 
    read_len : int
        Maximum read length to expect in the fastq file. Optionally used in iterative
        alignment mode. Estimated from the first read by default. Useful if input fastq
        is a composite of different read lengths.
